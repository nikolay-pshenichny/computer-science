- Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection that is used to store elements where the Last element In is the First one Out (LIFO).

- A Stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) collection


If a LinkedList is used as the internal storage, there will be some overhead, because we need to store Nodes and Pointers to elements
If an Array is used as the internal storage, less memory is required.
