Quick sort

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort

Divide and conquer algorithm


Performance:
  Worst case performance - O(n^2)
  Average performance - O(n log n)
  Best case performance - O(n log n);

Space required:
  All operations performed in the original data set. No additionally allocated space is required.
  Therefore, space requirement is O(n) 


*where: n - number of items to be sorted
